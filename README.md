# Effects of Air Pollution on the Accuracy of Financial Analysts’ Forecasts
This project examines how air pollution affects the accuracy of forecasts produced by financial analysts in Europe. It combines environmental data, such as pollutant concentrations and the Air Quality Index, with financial forecasts of earnings per share (EPS) over the period 2015–2023. The objective is to understand how pollution, beyond its impact on physical health, also influences cognitive performance, decision-making, and the reliability of financial forecasts.

The analysis seeks to determine whether air pollution significantly affects analysts’ forecast accuracy, to explore potential non-linear relationships between pollution exposure and forecast precision, and to measure the cumulative effects of pollutants over different time horizons, including daily, weekly, and bi-weekly periods.

The data are drawn from multiple sources. Financial forecasts come from the I/B/E/S database, while pollution-related information is obtained from the European Environment Agency and includes the AQI as well as measurements of NO₂, PM10, PM2.5, and SO₂. The study covers the period from 2015 to 2023, and all statistical and econometric analyses were conducted in RStudio, including descriptive statistics, principal component analysis, and model estimation.

The methodology relies on panel data econometric models with fixed effects at the analyst, country, and year levels. Several robustness checks were carried out to validate the results, including the use of instrumental variables such as planetary boundary layer height (PBLH), placebo tests based on randomly generated AQI values, and the estimation of non-linear models designed to detect potential threshold effects.

The results show a significant relationship between pollution levels and analysts’ forecast accuracy. They also reveal non-linear effects, as forecast errors increase with pollution but tend to stabilize, or even decrease, beyond certain thresholds. In addition, the analysis indicates that cumulative exposure over weekly or bi-weekly periods plays a key role in explaining variations in forecasting performance.

Overall, this project illustrates a comprehensive approach that combines environmental and financial data, advanced statistical analysis, and econometric modeling. It provides original insights into the links between air pollution and the performance of financial market participants, highlighting the subtle ways in which environmental conditions can affect the quality of economic decision-making.
